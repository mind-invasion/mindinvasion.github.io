        <p>Introduction</p>
        he Syrian Civil War (Arabic: ????? ??????? ????????, al-?arb al-?ahliyah as-suriyah)<br> is an ongoing multi-sided armed conflict in Syria fought between the Ba'athist Syrian Arab Republic led by President Bashar al-Assad, <br>along with domestic and foreign allies, and various domestic and foreign forces opposing both the Syrian government and each other in varying combinations.<br>[113] The war is currently the 2nd deadliest of the 21st century

        <h2>Contents</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class='mgo500' id='mego'>Assad government</li><br><br>
            The secular Ba'ath Syrian Regional Branch government came to power through a successful coup d'état in 1963.<br> For several years Syria went through additional coups and changes in leadership,[123] until in March 1971<br>, Hafez al-Assad, an Alawite, declared himself President. The secular Syrian Regional Branch remained the dominant political authority in what had<br> been a one-party state until the first multi-party election to the People's Council of Syria was held in 2012.[124] On 31 January 1973, Hafez al-Assad implemented a new constitution, which led to a national crisis. Unlike previous constitutions,<br> this one did not require that the president of Syria be a Muslim, leading to fierce <br>demonstrations in Hama, Homs and Aleppo organized by the Muslim Brotherhood and the ulama. The government survived a series of armed revolts by<br> Islamists, mainly members of the Muslim Brotherhood, from 1976 until 1982.<br><br><br>
            <li class='mgo500' id='mego2'>Demographics</li><br><br>The total population in July 2018 was estimated at 19,454,263 people; ethnic groups – approximately Arab 50%,<br> Alawite 15%, Kurd 10%, Levantine 10%, other 15% (includes Druze, Ismaili, Imami, Nusairi, Assyrian, Turkmen, Armenian); religions – Muslim 87% (official;<br> includes Sunni 74% and Alawi, Ismaili, and Shia 13%), Christian 10% (mainly of Eastern Christian churches[128] – may be smaller as a result of Christians fleeing the country), Druze 3%, Jewish (few remaining in Damascus and Aleppo).[129]<br><br>
            <li class='mgo500' id='mego3'>Socioeconomic backgroun</li><br><br>Socioeconomic inequality increased significantly after free market policies were initiated by Hafez al-Assad in his later years, and it accelerated after Bashar al-Assad came to power. With an emphasis on the service sector, these policies benefited a minority of the nation's population, mostly people who had connections with the government, and members of the Sunni merchant class of Damascus and Aleppo.[130] In 2010, Syria's nominal GDP per capita was only $2,834, comparable to Sub-Saharan African countries such as Nigeria and far lower than its neighbors such as Lebanon, with an annual growth rate of 3.39%, below most other developing countries
            <br><br><li class='mgo500' id='mego4'>Drought</li><br><br>This coincided with the most intense drought ever recorded in Syria, which lasted from 2006 to 2011 and resulted in widespread crop failure, an increase in food prices and a mass migration of farming families to urban centers.[133] This migration strained infrastructure already burdened by the influx of some 1.5 million refugees from the Iraq War.[134] The drought has been linked to anthropogenic global warming.
            <br><br><li class='mgo500' id='mego5'>Human rights</li><br><br>The human rights situation in Syria has long been the subject of harsh critique from global organizations.[139] The rights of free expression, association and assembly were strictly controlled in Syria even before the uprising.[140] The country was under emergency rule from 1963 until 2011 and public gatherings of more than five people were banned.[141] Security forces had sweeping powers of arrest and detention.[142] Despite hopes for democratic change with the 2000 Damascus Spring, Bashar al-Assad was widely regarded as having failed to implement any improvements. A Human Rights Watch report issued just before the beginning of the 2011 uprising stated that he had failed to substantially improve the state of human rights since taking power
            <br><br><li class='mgo500' id='mego6'>Chemical weapons</li><br><br>Sarin, mustard agent and chlorine gas have been used during the conflict. Numerous casualties led to an international reaction, especially the 2013 Ghouta attacks. A UN fact-finding mission was requested to investigate alleged chemical weapons attacks. In four cases UN inspectors confirmed the use of sarin gas.[160] In August 2016, a confidential report by the United Nations and the OPCW explicitly blamed the Syrian military of Bashar al-Assad for dropping chemical weapons (chlorine bombs) on the towns of Talmenes in April 2014 and Sarmin in March 2015 and ISIS for using sulfur mustard on the town of Marea in August 2015
            <br><br><li class='mgo500' id='mego7'>Cluster bombs</li><br><br>Syria is not parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions and does not recognize the ban on the use of cluster bombs. The Syrian Army is alleged to have begun using cluster bombs in September 2012. Steve Goose, director of the Arms Division at Human Rights Watch said "Syria is expanding its relentless use of cluster munitions, a banned weapon, and civilians are paying the price with their lives and limbs", "The initial toll is only the beginning because cluster munitions often leave unexploded bomblets that kill and maim long afterward."[164]
            <br><br><li  class='mgo500'id='mego8'>Thermobaric weapons</li><br><br>Russian thermobaric weapons, also known as "fuel-air bombs", have been used by the government side during the war. On 2 December 2015, The National Interest reported that Russia was deploying the TOS-1 Buratino multiple rocket launch system to Syria, which is "designed to launch massive thermobaric charges against infantry in confined spaces such as urban areas."[165] One Buratino thermobaric rocket launcher "can obliterate a roughly 200 by 400 metres (660 by 1,310 feet) area with a single salvo".[166] Since 2012, rebels have said that the Syrian Air Force (government forces) is using thermobaric weapons against residential areas occupied by the rebel fighters, such as during the Battle of Aleppo and also in Kafr Batna.[167] A panel of United Nations human rights investigators reported that the Syrian government used thermobaric bombs against the strategic town of Qusayr in March 2013.[168] In August 2013, the BBC reported on the use of napalm-like incendiary bombs on a school in northern Syria
            <br><br><li class='mgo500' id='mego9'>Anti-tank missiles</li><br><br>Several types of anti-tank missiles are in use in Syria. Russia has sent 9M133 Kornet, third-generation anti-tank guided missiles to the Syrian Government whose forces have used them extensively against armour and other ground targets to fight Jihadists and rebels.[170] U.S.-made BGM-71 TOW missiles are one of the primary weapons of rebel groups and have been primarily provided by the United States and Saudi Arabia.[171] The U.S. has also supplied many Eastern European sourced 9K111 Fagot launchers and warheads to Syrian rebel groups under its Timber Sycamore program
            <br><br><li class='mgo500' id='mego10'>Ballistic missiles</li><br><br>In June 2017, Iran attacked ISIL targets in the Deir ez-Zor area in eastern Syria with Zolfaghar ballistic missiles fired from western Iran,[173] in the first use of mid-range missiles by Iran in 30 years.[174] According to Jane's Defence Weekly, the missiles travelled 650–700 kilometre
            <br><br><li class='mgo500' id='mego11'>Deaths</li><br><br>On 2 January 2013, the United Nations stated that 60,000 had been killed since the civil war began, with UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay saying "The number of casualties is much higher than we expected, and is truly shocking."[195] Four months later, the UN's updated figure for the death toll had reached 80,000.[196] On 13 June 2013, the UN released an updated figure of people killed since fighting began, the figure being exactly 92,901, for up to the end of April 2013. Navi Pillay, UN high commissioner for human rights, stated that: "This is most likely a minimum casualty figure." The real toll was guessed to be over 100,000.[197][198] Some areas of the country have been affected disproportionately by the war; by some estimates, as many as a third of all deaths have occurred in the city of Homs
            <br><br><li class='mgo500' id='mego12'>Disease</li><br><br>Formerly rare infectious diseases have spread in rebel-held areas brought on by poor sanitation and deteriorating living conditions. The diseases have primarily affected children. These include measles, typhoid, hepatitis, dysentery, tuberculosis, diphtheria, whooping cough and the disfiguring skin disease leishmaniasis. Of particular concern is the contagious and crippling Poliomyelitis. As of late 2013 doctors and international public health agencies have reported more than 90 cases. Critics of the government complain that, even before the uprising, it contributed to the spread of disease by purposefully restricting access to vaccination, sanitation and access to hygienic water in "areas considered politically unsympathetic".[210]
             <br><br><li class='mgo500' id='mego13'>Displacement and refugee migration</li><br><br>The violence in Syria caused millions to flee their homes. As of March 2015, Al-Jazeera estimate 10.9 million Syrians, or almost half the population, have been displaced.[211] 3.8 million have been made refugees.[211] As of 2013, 1 in 3 of Syrian refugees (about 667,000 people) sought safety in Lebanon (normally 4.8 million population).[212] Others have fled to Jordan, Turkey, and Iraq. Turkey has accepted 1,700,000 (2015) Syrian refugees, half of whom are spread around cities and a dozen camps placed under the direct authority of the Turkish Government. Satellite images confirmed that the first Syrian camps appeared in Turkey in July 2011, shortly after the towns of Deraa, Homs, and Hama were besieged.[213] In September 2014, the UN stated that the number of Syrian refugees had exceeded 3 million.[214] According to the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Sunnis are leaving for Lebanon and undermining Hezbollah's status. The Syrian refugee crisis has caused the "Jordan is Palestine" threat to be diminished due to the onslaught of new refugees in Jordan. Greek Catholic Patriarch Gregorios III Laham claims more than 450,000 Syrian Christians have been displaced by the conflict.[215] As of September 2016, the European Union has reported that there are 13.5 million refugees in need of assistance in the country.[216]
           <br><br> <li class='mgo500' id='mego14'>Human rights violations</li><br><br>According to various human rights organizations and United Nations, human rights violations have been committed by both the government and the rebels, with the "vast majority of the abuses having been committed by the Syrian government".[217]
